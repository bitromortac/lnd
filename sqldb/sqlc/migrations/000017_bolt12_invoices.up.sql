-- bolt12_invoices holds the BOLT 12 data of a received invoice. The shared
-- invoices table stays protocol agnostic, so only BOLT 12 queries touch this
-- table. The receiver keeps no signed invoice string after stateless
-- settlement, so this row holds every BOLT 12 fact it needs later. A row also
-- marks its invoice as a BOLT 12 invoice.
